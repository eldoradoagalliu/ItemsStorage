#Items Storage Application

This project was build with Java SE 8 and MySQL. The connection with MySQL was
made with JDBC. It has the options to check the storage, add a new item in the
storage, delete the item from the storage and change the price of an item inside
the storage.

To run the project you need to add the dependencies of Java DB connector on the 
project structure and register the driver of the DB, which you can find on the 
comments in the DatabaseConnection.java file.
